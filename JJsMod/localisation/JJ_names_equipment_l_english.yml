 ### Naval Ships ###
 DOM_submarine_1:0 "S Class"
 DOM_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."
 #DOM_submarine_1b: "Barracuda Class"
 DOM_submarine_2:0 "Porpoise Class"
 DOM_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Porpoise Class submarine was the US Navy's first modern submarine designed and built following a series of experimental "V Boats" built in the late 20s and early 30s. Despite initial issues with the all-electric propulsion, the class held promise and was being considered as future designs. The class was armed with 6 torpedo tubes and a 3" deck gun."
 #DOM_submarine_2b: "Salmon Class"
 DOM_submarine_3:0 "Tambor Class"
 DOM_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Tambor class was the culmination of years of US Naval experimentation of both Submarine design to fit the role of "Fleet Boat" and perform well in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Armament was upgraded to 10 torpedo tubes with four firing aft, 3" deck gun with two AA guns for additional protection."
 #DOM_submarine_3b: "Gato Class"
 DOM_submarine_4:0 "Balao Class"
 DOM_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Balao Class was a continuation of the design rooted in the Tambor class. Improvements came in the form of hull reinforcement and upgrading the deck gun to a 5"/24 caliber along with numerous subtle design improvements."
 DOM_destroyer_1:0 "Clemson Class"
 DOM_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4"/50 caliber main guns, a 3"/23 caliber AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was aging and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
 #DOM_destroyer_1b: "Farragut Class"
 DOM_destroyer_2:0 "Sims Class"
 DOM_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sims Class was the largest "1500 Tonner" design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 caliber guns and included 12 centerline torpedo tubes."
 #DOM_destroyer_2b: "Benson & Gleaves Class"
 DOM_destroyer_3:0 "Fletcher Class"
 DOM_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5"/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
 DOM_destroyer_4:0 "Allen M Sumner Class"
 DOM_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5"/38 caliber guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve maneuvering during ASW operations."
 DOM_light_cruiser_1:0 "Omaha Class"
 DOM_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 caliber guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was aging but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
 DOM_light_cruiser_2:0 "Brooklyn Class"
 DOM_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximize firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
 DOM_light_cruiser_3:0 "Cleveland Class"
 DOM_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. The Cleveland Class keeps the 15 6" main gun arrangement, but increased its secondary 5" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry."
 DOM_light_cruiser_4:0 "Fargo Class"
 DOM_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Fargo Class improved on the successful Cleveland Class. It offered improved fields of AA fire thanks to a better designed pyramid-shaped superstructure."
 DOM_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Pensacola Class"
 DOM_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8"/55 guns. The hull armor was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."
 #DOM_heavy_cruiser_1b: "Portland Class"
 DOM_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Wichita Class"
 DOM_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 caliber guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5"/38 guns. "
 DOM_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Baltimore Class"
 DOM_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armor from the USS Wichita."
 DOM_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Oregon City Class"
 DOM_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers."
 DOM_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Lexington Class"
 DOM_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
 DOM_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class"
 DOM_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
 DOM_battleship_1:0 "New York Class"
 DOM_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor."
 #DOM_battleship_1b: "Pennsylvania Class"
 #DOM_battleship_1c: "New Mexico Class"
 DOM_battleship_2:0 "North Carolina Class"
 DOM_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
 #DOM_battleship_2b: "South Dakota Class"
 DOM_battleship_3:0 "Iowa Class"
 DOM_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
 DOM_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
 DOM_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 DOM_carrier_1:0 "Lexington Class"
 DOM_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations."
 DOM_carrier_2:0 "Ranger Class"
 DOM_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs."
 #DOM_carrier_2b: "Yorktown Class"
 #DOM_carrier_2c: "Wasp Class"
 DOM_carrier_3:0 "Essex Class"
 DOM_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large compliment of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
 DOM_carrier_4:0 "Midway Class"
 DOM_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armored deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
 DOM_SH_battleship_1:0 "Virginia Class"
 DOM_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
 DOM_SH_battleship_2:0 "Montana Class"
 DOM_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."

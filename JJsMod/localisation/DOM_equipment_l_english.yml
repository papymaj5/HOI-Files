 DOM_submarine_1:0 "S Class"
 DOM_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."

 #DOM_submarine_3b: "Gato Class"
 DOM_submarine_4:0 "Balao Class"

 DOM_destroyer_4:0 "Allen M Sumner Class DD IV"
 DOM_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased.

 DOM_light_cruiser_2:0 "Brooklyn Class CL II"
 DOM_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns.

After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
 DOM_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class BC II"
 DOM_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
